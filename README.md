# itch.io-discord-bot
A discord bot that can display analytics of your itch.io account.

For it to work, change the TOKEN variable in the 'discord_bot.js' file.

The command '!setApiKey' in discord sets your itch.io api key, for example `!setApiKey yourapikey`

To see your itch.io analytics you first must set the api key.
After you set your api key, you can type the command `!check (number)` and it will display the analytics as an embed, just change the number to an integer.

Other commands for bot:

`!status` - give itch.io server status

`!ping`

`!kick @user`

`!time` - outputs the time
